# Kotlin hello world in a browser

**Warning : highly experimental status**

This sample leverages Kotlin/Wasm and V8 with its Wasm GC, typed function references and exception handling proposals.

Require enabling Wasm GC support in your browser, for example with `chrome://flags/#enable-webassembly-garbage-collection` with Chrome.
